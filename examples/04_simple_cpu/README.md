# Simple 8-bit CPU Example

This example demonstrates and explains how to implement a simple 8-bit CPU using VHDL.
The CPU is a basic design and has limited functionality, but serves as a good starting point for demonstation purposes. The Overture computer architecture from the game [Turing Complete](https://turingcomplete.game/) will be implemented with some slight modifications / additions.

In contrast to the other examples, this will have a more theoretical, educational focus. But if you don't care about that, just run and load the project on your FPGA board and have fun with it!
